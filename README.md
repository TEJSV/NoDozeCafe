# NoDozeCafe app

Note: I couldn't work on the ui much because of my ongoing exams and Smart India Hackathon, but I have developed all the components using Object Oriented design principles and have tried to integrate the provider architecture design pattern in my app. Moreover, I will work on the UI as soon as my exams get over and commit the improvements.

Here is a link to the Drive which contains the build folder(having the required plugins and dependencies to run the app), which could not be uploaded to github because of the size:

Steps to run:

(1) git clone or download the complete zip code                                                                                           
(2) download the build folder from the given google drive
